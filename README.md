This git repo contains the slides and suppoorting code files for the talk I presented at the Big Mountaind Data and Development Conference in October of 2018. The slides present the c
current state of affairs within the information security community and offers some
examples of how AI is currently being used in the field. 

## Naive Bayes

The naive bayes files present how scikit-learns native naive bayes classifiers can be used
to predict spam email. The dataset is collected from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/)
but is presented here already processed with headers and able to be read in as a csv. The naivebayes.py can
be run will compare Gaussian, multinomial, complement, and Bernoulli distribution

## Phishing Sites

The phishing sites is based on code originally found [here](https://github.com/JonathanTay/CS-7641-assignment-1)  
The data set presented here is  a processed csv file from work done by researchers Mohammad, Rami, McCluskey, T.L. and Thabtah, Fadi
